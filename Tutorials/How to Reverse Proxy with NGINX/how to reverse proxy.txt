Before starting verify that your website is accessible via the domain and that you have added a cname entry in your dns for api that points to @,
this configures a subdomain for the api's use (see attached screenshot). Also verify that your API is running on internal port 81 and that the web server is running on port 8080. 
This tutorial assumes you are using my express web server which serves an index.html from views to internal port 8080. (check its attached tutorial for more)
**make sure port 443 and 80 is open on AWS** 
Use putty to ssh into your AWS ubuntu server EC2 container (https://www.quickvenom.org/ubuntu) 

$ sudo apt-get update
$ sudo apt-get install nginx
$ sudo chmod 777 -R /etc/nginx
$ sudo mkdir /etc/nginx/ssl
$ sudo rm -rf /etc/nginx/sites-enabled/default

copy default and api from this folder to /etc/nginx/sites-enabled using winscp
edit each to your proper server name and internal ip address
generate self signed credentials with;

$ sudo openssl req -x509 -nodes -days 365 -newkey rsa:4096 -keyout /etc/nginx/ssl/selfsigned.key -out /etc/nginx/ssl/selfsigned.crt

make sure that your common name matches your domain such as yourapp.com

$ sudo systemctl restart nginx
$ sudo chmod 777 -R /var/www
$ sudo cd /var/www/yourapp

copy the web server over now to this directory and run;

$ sudo npm install
$ sudo pm2 start app.js -i 0 --name "yourapp"

refer to the tutorial included with the web server for more details on building and serving SPA

$ sudo apt-get update
$ sudo apt-get install software-properties-common
$ sudo add-apt-repository ppa:certbot/certbot
$ sudo apt-get update
$ sudo apt-get install certbot

$ sudo certbot certonly --webroot -w /var/www/yourapp/views -d yourapp.com -d www.yourapp.com

change;

ssl_certificate           /etc/nginx/ssl/selfsigned.crt;
ssl_certificate_key       /etc/nginx/ssl/selfsigned.key;

to;

ssl_certificate           /etc/letsencrypt/live/<yourapp.com>/fullchain.pem;
ssl_certificate_key       /etc/letsencrypt/live/<yourapp.com>/privkey.pem;

where <yourapp.com> is where lets encrypt makes the certificate,
itll print it to the console on a sucessful creation

$ sudo systemctl restart nginx

Check online by going to the domain but https and the correct domain should be visible.
